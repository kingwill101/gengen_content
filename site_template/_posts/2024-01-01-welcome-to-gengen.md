This is the starter post. You can replace it with your own content or keep it around as a reference.

```bash
# Rebuild your site after editing content
gengen build
```

Posts live in the `_posts/` directory and follow the familiar `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` convention. Add new Markdown files there and they will automatically appear on the home page and `/posts/` index.
